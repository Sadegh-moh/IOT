# IoT Edge Computing Real-Time Scheduling System

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time scheduling system based on economic value using the **MBPT (Maximum Benefit Per Unit Time)** algorithm to optimize task allocation in edge computing environments. Unlike traditional methods that only consider task deadlines and execution times, this method also takes into account the economic profit of each task.

## Key Features

- **MBPT Algorithm**: Prioritizes tasks based on profit-to-execution-time ratio
- **Economic Value Consideration**: Each task has monetary profit and delay penalties
- **Fault Tolerance**: Task replication method with target reliability of 1-10⁻³
- **Two Scenarios**: 
  - Scenario A: 600-1000 IoT devices, 100 edge servers
  - Scenario B: 300 IoT devices, 30-100 edge servers
- **Baseline Comparisons**: PSO and Genetic Algorithm implementations
- **EdgeSimPy Integration**: Uses EdgeSimPy library for IoT simulation
- **UUNIFAST Algorithm**: Generates realistic task sets for simulation
